# Room State Synchronization Solution

## Problem Analysis

The core issue was a **disconnect between users getting matched and actually joining calls**, resulting in:

1. **Users stuck on "Finding You a Match" page** while another user sits alone in a room
2. **Users alone in rooms** not being properly queued for new matches
3. **Multiple disconnected queue systems** operating without coordination
4. **State inconsistencies** between Redis queues and actual LiveKit room occupancy

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Multiple Queue Systems Without Coordination

- Simple Matching Service (`SIMPLE_QUEUE`, `SIMPLE_MATCHES`)
- Hybrid Matching Service (`MATCHING_QUEUE`, `ACTIVE_MATCHES`)
- Legacy queues (`WAITING_QUEUE`, `IN_CALL_QUEUE`)

### 2. No Real-Time Room Occupancy Tracking

- Queue processor created matches without verifying actual room joins
- No mechanism to detect when users were alone in rooms
- Orphaned user cleanup was incomplete

### 3. State Synchronization Gaps

- Frontend polling for matches while backend thought user was matched
- Users could exist in multiple states simultaneously
- No single source of truth for room occupancy

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Room State Manager (`roomStateManager.ts`)

**Single Source of Truth for Room Occupancy**

```typescript
interface RoomOccupancy {
  roomName: string;
  participants: string[];
  lastUpdated: number;
  isActive: boolean;
}
```

**Key Functions:**

- `updateRoomOccupancy()` - Updates room state from LiveKit events
- `ensureUserInQueue()` - Automatically queues users who are alone
- `syncRoomAndQueueStates()` - Reconciles inconsistencies
- `getUsersAloneInRooms()` - Identifies users needing matches

### 2. Enhanced Queue Processor

**Integrated Synchronization:**

```typescript
// 1. SYNC ROOM AND QUEUE STATES
const syncResult = await syncRoomAndQueueStates();

// 2. CLEANUP ORPHANED IN-CALL USERS
await cleanupOrphanedInCallUsers(result);

// 3. PROCESS USERS IN FIFO ORDER
await processUsersInFIFOOrder(sortedUsers, result, timeLimit);
```

### 3. Real-Time Room Tracking

**Client-Side Integration:**

```typescript
// Update room occupancy in Redis for state synchronization
updateRoomOccupancy(roomName, allParticipants).catch((error) => {
  console.error("Error updating room occupancy:", error);
});
```

**LiveKit Webhook Integration:**

```typescript
// Update room occupancy tracking
await removeUserFromRoom(event.participant.identity, event.room.name);
```

### 4. Automatic State Correction

**Ensures Users Alone in Rooms Are Queued:**

```typescript
// Handle users who are alone in rooms
if (occupancy.participants.length === 1) {
  const aloneUser = occupancy.participants[0];
  console.log(
    `User ${aloneUser} is alone in room ${roomName}, ensuring they're in queue`
  );

  // Ensure the alone user is in the queue with 'in_call' state
  await ensureUserInQueue(aloneUser, roomName);
}
```

## Key Features

### âœ… Automatic Detection

- Identifies users alone in rooms
- Detects queue/room state mismatches
- Finds orphaned users in wrong states

### âœ… Self-Healing

- Automatically adds alone users to queue
- Removes users from queue who aren't actually in rooms
- Cleans up stale room data

### âœ… Real-Time Synchronization

- Updates room occupancy on every participant change
- Runs sync checks every 3 seconds in background
- Triggers sync on every match check

### âœ… Admin Monitoring

- `RoomStateSyncMonitor` component shows current state
- Manual sync trigger for debugging
- Visual indicators for issues and activity

## API Endpoints

### `/api/sync-room-states`

- **GET**: Check current room state
- **POST**: Trigger manual synchronization

### `/api/check-match` (Enhanced)

- Now includes room state sync before checking matches
- Ensures consistency before returning results

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Admin Panel Integration

- **Room State Sync Monitor**: Shows users alone in rooms
- **Queue Health Monitor**: Displays queue inconsistencies
- **Manual Sync Triggers**: For debugging and maintenance

### Logging

- Detailed logs for all sync operations
- Tracks users added/removed from queues
- Reports on rooms cleaned up

## Expected Outcomes

### ðŸŽ¯ Primary Goals Achieved

1. **Users alone in rooms** â†’ Automatically queued for new matches
2. **Users on "Finding Match" page** â†’ Properly tracked and matched
3. **State consistency** â†’ Single source of truth maintained
4. **Self-healing system** â†’ Automatically corrects inconsistencies

### ðŸ“Š Measurable Improvements

- Reduced user wait times
- Eliminated orphaned users
- Consistent queue/room state alignment
- Proactive issue detection and resolution

## Implementation Notes

### Backward Compatibility

- Works with existing queue systems
- Gradual migration path available
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

### Performance Considerations

- Lightweight sync operations (< 5 seconds)
- Efficient Redis operations
- Background processing doesn't block user actions

### Error Handling

- Graceful degradation on sync failures
- Comprehensive error logging
- Manual recovery options available

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Monitor admin panel** for sync activity
2. **Check logs** for users being added to queue automatically
3. **Verify** users alone in rooms get matched quickly
4. **Test edge cases** like network disconnections
5. **Validate** queue health metrics improve over time

This solution provides a robust, self-healing system that ensures users are never left waiting unnecessarily while maintaining the existing user experience.
