Integrated Room Creation in Match Process:**\n- **Enhanced `createMatch()` method**: Now automatically creates LiveKit rooms during match creation.\n- **Atomic Transaction with Room Creation**: The `executeAtomicMatchCreationWithRoom()` method ensures that both match creation AND room creation succeed together, or both fail with complete rollback.\n- **Token Generation**: Automatically generates access tokens for both users during the match creation process.\n- **Comprehensive Rollback**: If room creation fails, the entire match is rolled back including user states and queue positions.\n\n**2. Complete Room Lifecycle Management:**\n\n**🚀 Room Creation Integration:**\n- **`RoomManager` Integration**: Added RoomManager instance to MatchManager for seamless room operations.\n- **Automatic Room Setup**: Rooms are created with proper metadata linking to match sessions.\n- **Token Management**: User access tokens are generated and returned as part of the match creation process.\n- **Error Recovery**: Full rollback mechanisms if room creation fails during match creation.\n\n**🔄 Room Termination & Cleanup:**\n- **Enhanced `deleteMatch()` method**: Now includes automatic room termination when matches are deleted.\n- **`terminateMatch()` method**: Comprehensive match termination with proper user state transitions.\n- **Smart State Transitions**: Handles different termination scenarios (skip vs end) with appropriate user state management.\n- **Queue Re-integration**: Automatically re-adds users to matching queue when appropriate.\n\n**📊 Room Status Monitoring:**\n- **`getMatchRoomStatus()` method**: Provides comprehensive room status information for active matches.\n- **Health Monitoring**: Integrates room health checks with match status.\n- **Participant Tracking**: Monitors participant counts and identifies issues.\n\n**3. State Management Integration:**\n\n**🔄 Proper State Transitions:**\n- **CONNECTING → IN_CALL**: Room creation triggers state transitions.\n- **IN_CALL → DISCONNECTING → (IDLE|WAITING)**: Proper state flow during termination.\n- **Atomic State Changes**: User states are updated atomically with room operations.\n\n**⚡ Enhanced Match Creation Flow:**\n```typescript\n// New enhanced flow:\n1. Validate users in queue\n2. Remove users from queue  \n3. Update users to CONNECTING state\n4. Store match record\n5. Create LiveKit room + generate tokens ✨ NEW\n6. Return match data with room tokens ✨ NEW\n// Full rollback on any failure\n```\n\n**🎯 Termination Flow (Skip vs End):**\n```typescript\n// Skip: Both users → WAITING (re-queued)\n// End: Initiator → IDLE, Other → WAITING (re-queued)\n```\n\n**4. Technical Achievements:**\n\n**🛡️ Robust Error Handling:**\n- **Complete Rollback**: Any failure during room creation triggers full match rollback.\n- **Graceful Degradation**: Match cleanup continues even if room termination fails.\n- **Atomic Operations**: All state changes happen atomically or not at all.\n\n**📋 Enhanced Return Types:**\n- **`MatchCreationResult`**: Now includes room creation status and access tokens.\n- **Termination Results**: Detailed information about user state transitions.\n- **Room Status**: Comprehensive room and participant information.\n\n**🔧 New Methods Added:**\n- **`terminateMatch(sessionId, reason, initiatingUser)`**: Complete match termination with state handling.\n- **`getMatchRoomStatus(sessionId)`**: Room status monitoring for active matches.\n- **Enhanced `deleteMatch(sessionId, reason)`**: Room termination integrated into match deletion.\n\n**5. Integration Benefits:**\n\n**🎮 Seamless User Experience:**\n- **One-Step Match Creation**: Users get both match data AND room access tokens in one operation.\n- **Proper State Flow**: Users never get stuck in incorrect states during room transitions.\n- **Automatic Cleanup**: Rooms and matches are properly cleaned up when sessions end.\n\n**⚡ Performance Optimizations:**\n- **Batch Operations**: Multiple Redis operations are batched for efficiency.\n- **Reduced Round-trips**: Room creation and token generation happen together.\n- **Efficient State Management**: Minimal state transition overhead.\n\n**🔄 Complete Lifecycle Support:**\n- **Match Creation** → Room Creation → Token Generation\n- **Active Session** → Room Monitoring → Health Checks  \n- **Session End** → Room Termination → State Cleanup → Queue Re-integration\n\n**Status: COMPLETE** - Room lifecycle management is fully integrated with the matching system. The MatchManager now provides end-to-end room lifecycle management from creation to termination, with proper state management and error recovery mechanisms.\n</info added on 2025-06-10T21:23:25.881Z>",

Define Type for End Response\n   - File: src/types/random-chat.ts\n   - Add interface EndCallResponse { success: boolean; message: string; nextState: 'IDLE' | 'WAITING' | 'CONNECTING' | 'IN_CALL'; otherUserNextState: 'IDLE' | 'WAITING' | 'CONNECTING' | 'IN_CALL' }\n   - Export for use in hook.\n\n2. Update useRandomChat.endCall\n   - File: src/hooks/useRandomChat.ts\n   - Fetch /api/simple-matching/end returns EndCallResponse.\n   - Parse JSON; if response.ok && data.success:\n       • Use toast.success(data.message)\n       • setChatState(data.nextState) (fallback to 'IDLE')\n     Else:\n       • toast.error(error message)\n       • setError(error)\n   - Remove immediate setChatState('IDLE') before fetch; instead optimistically switch to 'DISCONNECTING' maybe, then after success set according to response.\n   - Continue to stopPolling/stopHeartbeat and clear token/session.\n\n3. Confirmation Modal for End Action\n   - Create new component src/components/room/EndConfirmDialog.tsx using shadcn <Dialog> components.\n   - Props: open, onConfirm, onCancel.\n   - Display message \"End the call? This will disconnect you and re-queue your partner.\" with Confirm and Cancel buttons.\n\n4. Integrate modal into CallActionButtons\n   - File: src/components/room/CallActionButtons.tsx\n   - Manage local state showConfirm (boolean).\n   - Modify End button onClick to setShowConfirm(true).\n   - Render <EndConfirmDialog open={showConfirm} ...>.\n   - onConfirm triggers onEnd prop then setShowConfirm(false).\n\n5. Show toast after ending\n   - Already in hook in step 2.\n\n6. ESLint & Build checks: ensure imports (\"use client\"), functional components typed, no unused vars.\n</info added on 2025-06-10T22:10:56.977Z>",
