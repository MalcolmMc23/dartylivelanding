# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Matching Engine with Cooldown System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a FIFO matching engine that pairs users from the waiting queue and implements a cooldown system to prevent re-matching with the same person for 30 seconds.
# Details:
1. Implement queue processing logic that selects users in FIFO order
2. Create atomic match creation operation that:
   - Removes two users from waiting queue
   - Creates a match record
   - Updates both users' states to CONNECTING
3. Implement cooldown system using Redis sorted sets:
   - When users disconnect, add their pair to a cooldown set with 30-second expiry
   - Check this set before creating matches to prevent re-matching
4. Add match creation validation to ensure both users are in valid states
5. Implement efficient batch processing for high-volume scenarios

Example matching algorithm:
```javascript
async function processMatches() {
  // Get users from waiting queue (oldest first)
  const waitingUsers = await redis.zrange('matching:waiting', 0, -1, 'WITHSCORES');
  
  // Process in pairs
  for (let i = 0; i < waitingUsers.length - 1; i += 2) {
    const user1 = waitingUsers[i];
    const user2 = waitingUsers[i+1];
    
    // Check if this pair is in cooldown
    const pairKey = [user1, user2].sort().join(':');
    const inCooldown = await redis.exists(`cooldown:${pairKey}`);
    
    if (!inCooldown) {
      // Create match and update states atomically
      await createMatch(user1, user2);
    }
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for the matching algorithm
2. Test cooldown functionality with various time intervals
3. Stress test with large user pools
4. Test edge cases like odd number of users
5. Verify atomic operations work correctly under load
6. Test recovery from failures during matching process
7. Benchmark matching performance with different queue sizes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement FIFO Waiting Queue Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a Redis-based FIFO queue structure to track users waiting to be matched, with timestamps for proper ordering.
### Details:
Use Redis sorted sets with join timestamp as score to maintain FIFO order. Implement functions to add users to the waiting queue with their join time, retrieve users in order, and remove users when matched or disconnected. The queue should store user IDs and maintain their waiting status.

## Subtask 2.1 Implementation Complete! ✅

**FIFO Waiting Queue Structure Successfully Implemented**

### Core Components Created:

**1. `matchingQueue.ts` - Dedicated Queue Manager**
- Created a new `MatchingQueueManager` class to provide a clear, domain-specific API for all waiting queue operations.
- This class encapsulates the queue logic, abstracting away the underlying state management details.

### Key Features Implemented:

- **`addUserToQueue(userId)`**: Adds a user to the FIFO queue.
- **`removeUserFromQueue(userId)`**: Removes a single user.
- **`removeMultipleUsersFromQueue(userIds)`**: Removes multiple users in a single, efficient batch operation.
- **`getNextUsers(count)`**: Retrieves users in FIFO order (oldest first) for matching.
- **`getQueueSize()`**: Returns the current number of users waiting.
- **`isUserInQueue(userId)`**: Checks if a specific user is in the queue.

### Technical Achievements:
- **Clean Abstraction:** The `MatchingQueueManager` provides a clean and intuitive API for the matching engine, separating queue logic from general state management.
- **Efficient Batch Operations:** The `removeMultipleUsersFromQueue` method uses a single Redis `ZREM` command for optimal performance when matching users.
- **Built on Existing Infrastructure:** Leverages the robust `RedisStateManager` created in Task 1, ensuring consistency and reliability.

**Status: COMPLETE** - The FIFO waiting queue structure is fully implemented and ready to be used by the matching engine in the upcoming subtasks.

## 2. Develop Cooldown System Using Redis [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a cooldown mechanism that prevents recently matched users from being paired again for 30 seconds.
### Details:
Create Redis functions to add user pairs to a cooldown set with 30-second expiry using sorted sets or Redis TTL features. Implement a function to check if a potential match is in cooldown. Use a consistent format for pair keys (e.g., sorting user IDs alphabetically before joining). Ensure the cooldown is applied bidirectionally.

## Subtask 2.2 Implementation Complete! ✅

**Cooldown System Using Redis Successfully Implemented**

### Core Components Created:

**1. `cooldownManager.ts` - Dedicated Cooldown Manager**
- Created a new `CooldownManager` class to handle all logic related to user pair cooldowns.
- This provides a clean, encapsulated API for the matching engine.

### Key Features Implemented:

- **TTL-Based Cooldowns:** Uses standard Redis keys with a 30-second TTL (`SETEX` command) for efficient, automatic expiration of cooldowns.
- **Consistent Pair Keys:** Implemented a `createKey` method that sorts user IDs to ensure that the cooldown key is the same regardless of the order in which the user IDs are provided (e.g., `cooldown:userA:userB`).
- **`setCooldown(userId1, userId2)`**: Applies a 30-second cooldown to a pair of users.
- **`isPairInCooldown(userId1, userId2)`**: Checks if a specific pair is currently on cooldown.
- **`checkMultiplePairs(pairs)`**: An efficient batch operation using Redis `MGET` to check the cooldown status of multiple pairs at once. This is crucial for optimizing the matching loop.

### Technical Achievements:
- **Efficient & Scalable:** Using TTL-based keys is the most performant way to handle cooldowns in Redis, avoiding the need for manual cleanup jobs.
- **Robust Key Management:** The sorted key generation prevents duplicate or missed cooldowns.
- **Batch Operations:** The `checkMultiplePairs` function will allow the matching engine to check many potential pairs with a single round-trip to Redis, significantly improving performance.
- **Redis Interface Enhanced:** Added the `mget` command to the Redis interface and fake client to support the batch-checking functionality.

**Status: COMPLETE** - The cooldown system is fully implemented and ready to be integrated into the matching engine. It provides a reliable and efficient mechanism to prevent immediate re-matching.

## 3. Create Atomic Match Creation Operation [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop an atomic operation that creates a match between two users, updates their states, and removes them from the waiting queue.
### Details:
Implement a createMatch function that uses Redis transactions to ensure atomicity. The function should: 1) Remove both users from the waiting queue, 2) Create a match record with timestamp and match ID, 3) Update both users' states to CONNECTING, and 4) Return the match details. Handle potential race conditions where users may have already left the queue.
<info added on 2025-06-10T07:41:45.789Z>
## Subtask 2.3 Implementation Plan

**Goal:** Create an atomic match creation operation that safely creates matches between two users.

### Current Infrastructure Analysis:
- ✅ Redis state manager exists (src/lib/stateManager.ts)
- ✅ Matching queue manager exists (src/lib/matchingQueue.ts) 
- ✅ Cooldown manager exists (src/lib/cooldownManager.ts)

### Implementation Requirements:
1. **Atomic Operation**: Use Redis transactions (MULTI/EXEC) to ensure all operations succeed or fail together
2. **Remove users from waiting queue**: Use existing matchingQueueManager
3. **Create match record**: Store match data with sessionId, roomName, user1, user2, createdAt
4. **Update user states**: Transition both users from WAITING to CONNECTING 
5. **Return match details**: Provide all necessary info for the frontend
6. **Race condition handling**: Verify users are still in queue before proceeding

### Technical Approach:
- Create a new `matchManager.ts` module with `createMatch()` function
- Use Redis transactions for atomicity
- Generate unique session/room IDs
- Implement proper error handling and rollback
- Return structured match data

### Files to create/modify:
- `src/lib/matchManager.ts` (new file)
- Potentially update types in `src/types/` if needed
