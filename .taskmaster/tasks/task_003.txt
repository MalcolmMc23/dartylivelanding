# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Room Management with LiveKit Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop room management system that creates, monitors, and destroys LiveKit WebRTC rooms based on user matches and disconnections.
# Details:
1. Set up LiveKit client integration with proper authentication
2. Implement room lifecycle management:

  // Create LiveKit room with 2-participant limit
  const room = await livekitClient.createRoom({
    name: roomName,
    maxParticipants: 2,
    emptyTimeout: 30 // auto-close after 30 seconds empty
  });
  
  // Store room metadata
  await redis.hset(`room:${roomName}`, {
    user1: user1Id,
    user2: user2Id,
    createdAt: Date.now(),
    status: 'active'
  });
  
  // Update user states to reference this room
  await redis.hset(`user:${user1Id}`, 'currentRoom', roomName);
