# Skip Race Condition Fix - Implementation Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Check-Disconnect Endpoint
**File**: `/src/app/api/simple-matching/check-disconnect/route.ts`
- Now checks multiple flags: `force-disconnect`, `skip-in-progress`, `pre-skip`, and `room-deleted`
- Returns the reason for disconnection
- Clears all flags atomically

### 2. Updated Skip Route with Atomic Operations
**File**: `/src/app/api/simple-matching/skip/route.ts`
- Sets `pre-skip` flag immediately upon skip request
- Sets multiple redundant flags atomically BEFORE any cleanup:
  - `skip-in-progress` for both users
  - `force-disconnect` with 5-minute TTL
  - `room-deleted` flag for the room
  - `skip-notification` with metadata
- This ensures the other user will detect the skip even if there are timing issues

### 3. Reduced Polling Intervals
- **`/src/components/hooks/useLeftBehindStatus.ts`**: Reduced from 2000ms to 500ms
- **`/src/app/random-chat/page.tsx`**: 
  - Check-disconnect polling when in call: 2000ms → 500ms
  - Check-match polling when waiting: 2000ms → 500ms

### 4. New Room Validity Check Endpoint
**File**: `/src/app/api/simple-matching/check-room-valid/route.ts`
- Provides an additional way to check if a room is still valid
- Checks `room-deleted`, `skip-in-progress`, and `force-disconnect` flags

## Expected Improvements

### Before Fix:
- Users could be alone in rooms for 2-4 seconds after their partner skips
- Race conditions could cause missed disconnect notifications
- Sequential operations created timing windows

### After Fix:
- Detection time reduced to 0.5-1 second maximum
- Multiple redundant flags prevent missed disconnections
- Atomic flag setting eliminates most race conditions
- Room deletion flag provides immediate notification

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Concurrent Skips**: Have two users skip at exactly the same time
2. **Test Rapid Skips**: Skip multiple partners in quick succession
3. **Monitor Logs**: Track the time between skip initiation and partner detection
4. **Network Delay Test**: Add artificial latency to test edge cases

## Monitoring

Add these metrics to track effectiveness:

```javascript
// In skip route
console.log('[Skip] Performance:', {
  skipStart: Date.now(),
  userId,
  otherUserId,
  roomName
});

// In client when detecting skip
console.log('[Client] Skip detected:', {
  detectedAt: Date.now(),
  detectionMethod: 'polling',
  reason: data.reason
});
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Replace polling with real-time push notifications
2. **WebSocket Integration**: Use LiveKit's data channels for instant notifications
3. **Redis Pub/Sub**: Implement real-time event broadcasting
4. **Lua Scripts**: Use Redis Lua scripts for truly atomic multi-key operations

## Deployment Notes

- No database migrations required
- Backward compatible with existing clients
- Can be deployed incrementally
- Monitor Redis memory usage due to additional flags
