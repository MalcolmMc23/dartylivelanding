here’s a high-level architecture and user-flow sketch for an Omegle-style random video chat using LiveKit as your media layer and a separate “matching” service to pair people:

1. Separation of Concerns
   Matching Service
   – Manages queues, pairing logic, session records.
   – Stateless HTTP API + Redis (for fast queues) + PostgreSQL (for history, rate-limits, blocklists).

LiveKit Server
– Purely handles signalling, SFU/TURN, room lifecycles.
– Exposes its own REST/WebSocket API and webhooks for room events (participant joined/left).

Keeping these separate lets you scale matching logic independently of media.

2. Core Data Structures
   Redis Queues
   – waitingQueue (list of socket-IDs or user-IDs ready to be matched).
   – activeSessions:{userId} → sessionID

Postgres Tables
– sessions (session_id, user_a, user_b, started_at, ended_at, ended_by)
– users (id, status, blocklist, …)

3. User Flow
   Landing / “Start Chat” Click

Frontend opens WS to Matching Service.

Sends {"action":"enqueue", userId}.

Enqueue Logic

If waitingQueue is empty → push userId and wait.

Else → pop one waiting user (peerId), create a new session:

session = INSERT INTO sessions(...)

Call LiveKit REST: POST /rooms → { roomName }

Return { roomName, token } to both clients.

Joining the Room

Frontend (React + LiveKit JS) calls liveKit.connect(url, token) → joins roomName.

Show participants’ video tracks.

In-Call: Skip / End Buttons

Skip

Frontend: leaveRoom() on LiveKit.

Send {"action":"skip", sessionId} to Matching Service.

Matching Service marks session ended_by=“skip”, ended_at=now(),
optionally enqueues the skipper back (if desired).

Matching Service triggers new pairing for the skipper (go to step 2).

End

Frontend: leaveRoom() on LiveKit.

Send {"action":"end", sessionId} to Matching Service.

Matching Service marks session ended_by=“end”, ended_at=now().

Show “Thanks for chatting!” screen or re-enqueue if you want to auto-requeue.

LiveKit Webhooks (Optional Sync)

Subscribe to LiveKit’s participant_disconnected and room_finished webhooks.

If somebody disconnects unexpectedly, your Matching Service can mark the session ended to free resources (e.g. detect network drop).

4. State Synchronization
   Component Source of Truth Sync Mechanism
   Who’s in a Room LiveKit room memberships Matching Service writes room → DB; LiveKit webhooks to catch unplanned leaves.
   Who’s waiting Redis queue All enqueue/dequeue via Matching API.
   Session history Postgres sessions table Matching Service writes on match/start/end.

When to call LiveKit:
Always after matching service decides to start or end a session.

When to update Matching DB:
Immediately on enqueue, match, skip/end actions; plus via webhooks to handle disconnects.

5. Example Sequence (Skip)

   sequenceDiagram
   participant C as Client A
   participant M as Matching API
   participant R as Redis
   participant C2 as Client B
   participant LK as LiveKit

C->>M: enqueue(userA)
M->>R: R.push(waitingQueue, userA)
C2->>M: enqueue(userB)
M->>R: R.pop(waitingQueue) => userA
M->>DB: INSERT sessions(userA,userB)
M->>LK: POST /rooms => room123
M->>C: {tokenA, room123}
M->>C2: {tokenB, room123}

C->>LK: connect(room123, tokenA)
C2->>LK: connect(room123, tokenB)

C->>C: [skip button clicked]
C->>LK: leaveRoom()
C->>M: skip(sessionId)
M->>DB: UPDATE sessions END skip
M->>R: R.push(waitingQueue, userA)
Note over C: UI shows “Finding next...” 6. Tips & Best Practices
Heartbeat / Ping: let clients periodically ping Matching Service to confirm connectivity.

Rate-limit / Abuse: track how often someone skips; block after N skips or too-fast loops.

Scalability:

Use horizontal scaling on your Matching API behind a load-balancer;

Redis pub/sub to notify all instances when a new user enters the queue.

Persistence: store minimal logs in Postgres; rely on Redis for ephemeral state.

Deployment:

Host Matching Service separately (e.g. on Railway);

LiveKit can be self-hosted or via LiveKit Cloud.

With this separation, your front end only ever talks to two backends:

Matching Service (HTTP/WS for enqueue, skip, end)

LiveKit (JS SDK for media)

That makes it easy to reason about matchmaking logic independently from your video infrastructure.
