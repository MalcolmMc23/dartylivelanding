# Matching Issue Fix Summary

## Problem

Users were getting stuck where one user would be in a room alone but marked as matched, while the other user was left on the "Finding You a Match" page but not in the queue.

## Root Cause

The issue was a race condition between:

1. Match creation in Redis
2. Users joining the LiveKit room
3. Match validation checking room occupancy

The sequence was:

1. Match created in Redis
2. Both clients notified of match and redirect to room
3. Match validator runs (15 seconds later) and sees no room occupancy data
4. Match invalidated and both users requeued
5. One client connects to room and updates occupancy
6. Other client stuck because already requeued

## Solution

### 1. Pre-populate Room Occupancy (queueProcessor.ts)

- Immediately update room occupancy when a match is created
- This prevents match validator from thinking room is empty
- Added `updateRoomOccupancy(roomName, [user1.username, user2.username])` after match creation

### 2. Increase Match Validation Timeout (matchValidator.ts)

- Increased `MATCH_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT` from 15 seconds to 30 seconds
- Gives users more time to actually join the room

### 3. Improved Match Validation Logic (matchValidator.ts)

- More lenient validation when room occupancy data exists
- Check if occupancy data is recent (within 60 seconds)
- Give matches more time if they're still new (under 60 seconds)
- Check both room occupancy and LiveKit room state

### 4. Preserve Room Occupancy During Sync (roomSyncManager.ts)

- Don't overwrite room occupancy when LiveKit sync fails
- Check for existing occupancy data before marking room as empty
- Prevents premature cleanup of pre-populated room data

### 5. Protect Recent Matches from Cleanup (roomStateManager.ts)

- Don't clean up rooms that have active matches less than 2 minutes old
- Prevents race condition where room gets cleaned up before users join

## Key Changes Made

1. **queueProcessor.ts**: Added immediate room occupancy update after match creation
2. **matchValidator.ts**: Increased timeout and improved validation logic
3. **roomSyncManager.ts**: Preserve occupancy data during LiveKit sync failures
4. **roomStateManager.ts**: Protect recent matches from premature cleanup

## Expected Behavior After Fix

1. Users get matched and both are redirected to room
2. Room occupancy is immediately populated with both usernames
3. Match validator sees occupancy data and keeps match active
4. Both users have time to connect to LiveKit
5. No premature match invalidation or user requeuing

## Testing

- Test with two users joining queue simultaneously
- Verify both users end up in the same room
- Check that match validation doesn't prematurely clean up matches
- Ensure room occupancy is properly tracked throughout the process
